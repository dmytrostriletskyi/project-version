## Getting started

If you found this project useful, but it does not really fit your development and releasing processes, 
[create an issue](https://github.com/dmytrostriletskyi/project-version/issues) with your proposals, please.

Also, if you have any questions after reading the documentation, check [FAQ](#faq). If there are no answers,
[create an issue](https://github.com/dmytrostriletskyi/project-version/issues) with your question, please.

### End users

An end user of the project is a software or DevOps-related engineer who develop, release and deploy projects that need
explicit, strict and automatic project version management for tags, images, API and/or libraries.

### Semantic versioning

There is the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). To make a long story short, it is versioning specification
with major, minor and patch numbers telling us what the current version of a project is and how to react on its new 
versions' updates. Example of the project version following semantic versioning is `1.3.12` where the first digit is
major number, the second digit is minor number, and the third digit is patch number.

These are the rules of increasing chose numbers:

1. Increase major version when you make incompatible API changes such as change a name of a required function's or API
   parameter.
   
   ```bash
   Before changes: 1.3.12
   After changes: 2.0.0
   ```

2. Increase minor version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner such as add a new optional
   function's or API parameter.
   
   ```bash
   Before changes: 1.3.12
   After changes: 1.4.0
   ```

3. Increase match version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

   ```bash
   Before changes: 1.3.12
   After changes: 1.3.13
   ```

You have probably seen semantic versioning in your programming language's packages such as 
[JavaScript's axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) (e.g. version `0.24.0`) or 
[Python requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (e.g. version `2.27.1`).

### Project version

`project version` is just a set of principles to maintain project versioning and 
[command line interface](#command-line-interface) that helps not to forget about those principles such as a code style 
and linters to check its compliance. 

`project version` requires having a file named `.project-version` in the root directory containing a project version. 
With this file, developers declare single source to fetch a project version from for things like `Git` tags or `Docker` 
images. 

![](/assets/project-version-file.png)

### Usage

Now you can reuse a project version from `.project-version` file for multiple release-related purposes:

1. There may be situations when you deployed the new version of an application but do not have deployment logs, or you 
   deployed the new version of a application but logs tell nothing, or do not have `Git` information. In all the cases 
   it may be useful to enter your application's runtime and check file `.project-version` to know the exact version 
   which is related to the codebase. 
   
   ```bash
   $ cat .project-version
   1.3.12
   ```

2. Instead of using `Git` commit SHA or its short version for `Docker` images, you can use a project version.
   
   ```bash
   $ docker build --tag facebook/react:v$(cat .project-version) -f Dockerfile .
   ```

3. Instead of using `Git` commit SHA or its short version for `GitHub` release version number, you can use a project 
   version.
   
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master
     
      jobs:
       release:
         runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Create Release
             uses: actions/create-release@v1
             with:
               tag_name: $(cat .project-version)
               release_name: Release v$(cat .project-version)
   ```

4. Instead of supporting package version (`Python package`, `Gem` or `JAR`) in a dedicated file, you can automatically 
   use a project version. `Python package` with its `setup.py` for building packages is illustrated below:
  
   ```python
   with open('.project-version', 'r') as project_version_file:
       project_version = project_version_file.read().strip()
  
   setup(
       version=project_version,
       name='project-version',
       ...
   )
   ```

5. In case you manage an infrastructure as a code (e.g. `Kubernetes`), you may face challenges of supporting multiple
   major version of your project (e.g. `HTTP API`). Without automation, you should create new major version 
   configurations manually.

   Let us consider the example where you have API's first version deployment configurations:
    
   ```bash
   $ ls deployment/
   ├── deployment
   │   ├── v1
   │   │   └── deployment.yaml
   │   │   └── ingress.yaml
   │   │   └── service.yaml
   
   $ cat /deployment/v1/deployment.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     namespace: api-v1
   ```
   
   When it is time to create API's second version, you can simply copy previous version configurations and substitute
   `v1` to `v2`.

   ```bash
   $ echo .project-version
   2.0.0
   $ export PROJECT_PREVIOUS_MAJOR_VERSION=$(($cat .project-version)-1)
   $ echo $PROJECT_MAJOR_VERSION
   1
   $ export PROJECT_MAJOR_VERSION=$(cut -d '.' -f 1 <<< "$(cat .project-version)")
   $ echo $PROJECT_PREVIOUS_MAJOR_VERSION
   2
   $ cp -r \
         deployment/v$PROJECT_PREVIOUS_MAJOR_VERSION deployment/v$PROJECT_MAJOR_VERSION
   $ find deployment/ -type f -exec sed -i \
         's/namespace: v$PROJECT_PREVIOUS_MAJOR_VERSION/namespace: v$PROJECT_MAJOR_VERSION/g' {} +
   ```

   After, you automatically get deployment configurations for the new version:

   ```yaml
   $ ls deployment/
   ├── deployment
   │   ├── v1
   │   │   └── deployment.yaml
   │   │   └── ingress.yaml
   │   │   └── service.yaml
   │   ├── v2
   │   │   └── deployment.yaml
   │   │   └── ingress.yaml
   │   │   └── service.yaml
   
   $ cat /deployment/v2/deployment.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     namespace: api-v2
   ```
   
And there is much more cases when relying on a project version from its file makes software releasing easier.

### Maintenance

All use cases described above requires a project version always be up-to-date and never corrupted. In case it is not,
you can release the same version twice, for example. To avoid this, `project-version` is tightly bound to a branching
model with its release life-cycle. Let's consider how `project-version` works with the most popular branching models
`Git flow` and `GitHub flow`.

In `Git flow`, developers do features in feature branches and merge them to `develop` branch. When `develop` branch
has a set of features merged, a release is created (with a separate branch for it) and deployed. To define a release 
version, `project-version` requests a developer to make an additional commit into `develop` branch that changes 
`.project-version` file.

In `GitHub flow`, developers do features in feature branches and merge them to `develop` branch. Once a single feature
is merged to `develop` branch, a release is immediately created (with no separate branch) and deployed. To define a
release version, `project-version` requests a developer to make an additional commit into a feature branch that changes 
`.project-version` file.

## Command line interface

This chapter describes a set of command line interface (automation scripts) with descriptive explanation of its 
use-cases that help to manage a project version. The command line interface is completely optional but helpful. It
helps developers not to forget about increasing a project version or auto-increase when needed.

### Installation

Install using `pip3`:

```bash
$ pip3 install project-version
```

### Version

Get the version of the package — `project-version --version`:

```bash
$ project-version --version
project-version, version 0.1.0
```

### Help

Get the detailed description of all supported commands by the package — `project-version --help`:

```bash
$ project-version --help
Usage: project-version [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Project version command-line interface.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check  Check whether specified project version is increased properly.
```

### Check

Check whether specified project version is increased properly — `project-version check`.

| base-branch  | String | Yes      | -                 | A branch to compare a project version with. Usually, a default branch.                                                                              |
| head-branch  | String | Yes      | -                 | A branch to get its project version for comparison. Usually, a feature branch.                                                                      |

Example of usage:

```bash
$ project-version check \
    --provider=GitHub \
    --organization=facebook \
    --repository=react \
    --base-branch=master \
    --head-branch=map-children-components
```

A use case:

The use case of the command is to prevent merging feature branches to `develop` or `master` that have not increased
a project version. As illustrated below: if both `master ` and feature branch have project version `1.1.3`, the command
exits with failed status code, if feature branch has `1.2.0` and `master` has `1.1.3` (lower version), the command exits 
with succeed status code.

| head-branch  | String | Yes      | -                 | A branch to push bumped project version to. Usually, a feature branch.                                                                      |

The example of usage:

```bash
$ project-version bump \
    --provider=GitHub \
    --organization=facebook \
    --repository=react \
    --base-branch=master \
    --head-branch=dependabot/npm/core-js-3.6.4
```

A use case:

There are tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) that automatically do updates to your codebase.
`Dependabot` tracks your requirements' versions and keep them up-to-date through proposing pull requests. The example
of changes is illustrated below:

<img src="/assets/bump-command-auto-changes.png">

Usually, codebase is covered with tests and there is no need to review such small changes and developers setup these 
pull requests to be merged automatically. But it will be impossible with `project version` as it requires a project
version to be increased manually. The bump command can be applied here, you just configure that if a pull request
is opened by `Dependabot` and then execute the bumping command.

<img src="/assets/bump-command-auto-commit.png">

The example of a pipeline configuration:

```yaml
---
name: Pull request workflow

on:
  pull_request_target:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  check-project-version:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install project version
        run: pip3 install project-version
      - name: Bump project version if it is non-human pull request
        if: ${{ github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' || github.actor == 'facebook-bot' }}
        run: |
          project-version bump \
              --provider=GitHub \
              --organization=facebook \
              --repository=react \
              --base-branch=master \
              --head-branch=map-children-components \ 
              --access-token=${{ secrets.GIT_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

```

A use case:

When you [squash merge](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/squashing-commits)
your feature branches, your `develop` or `master` commits history might looks like:

```
Allow taxi drivers to schedule a break (#567)
Integrate Spotify (#566)
Create OpenAPI spification (#565)

If you pick one and create a release with a commit as the title, you will have `Allow taxi drivers to schedule a break (#567)`.
If you add a release version, it will go uglier like `Release v3.6.1: Allow taxi drivers to schedule a break (#567)`.
The release command remove all the mess and create the following title `v3.6.1: allow taxi drivers to schedule a break`.

The example of a pipeline configuration:

```yaml
---
name: Master workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    outputs:
      project_version: ${{ steps.get_project_version.outputs.project_version }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install project version
        run: pip3 install project-version
      - name: Get a version of the project
        id: get_project_version
        run: echo "::set-output name=project_version::$(cat .project-version)"
      - name: Release
        run: |
          project-version release \
              --provider=GitHub \
              --organization=facebook \
              --repository=react \
              --branch=master \
              --project-version=${{ steps.get_project_version.outputs.project_version }} \
              --access-token=${{ secrets.GIT_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

## FAQ

1. **Q:** `project-version`is written in `Python`, but my project's stack is different. Why should I support Python` for 
   this?
  
   **A:** When you develop a project, you do not need `Python`, but only `.project-version` file. The only place you need
   `Python` on is your pipelines runner such as `GitHub Actions`, `Jenkins` or `GitLab CI/CD` to run the command line
   interface. You can use isolated environment such as `Docker` containers:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     check-project-version:
       runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
       container:
         image: python:3.9.0-slim
       ...
   ```

2. **Q:** Why should a developer increase a project version manually for a feature, or a set of features?

   **A:** When a developer does a change, the only they know a degree of change: either patch, minor or major. There is
   no machine learning model or other software that can describe a degree of change instead of a person who made those
   changes.
   
3. **Q:** If we merge feature branches often, many concurrent feature branches should pull new project version often. Is
   it fine?

   **A:** Yes, it is fine. It is a price you pay for the project management. Also, keep in mind that most time you
    develop a feature, and only little time you pull other feature branches' changes and merge.
